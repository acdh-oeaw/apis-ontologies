The colophon sentence following the verses suggests that this is an homage to ‘Jad, the author of 1_010_02 that precedes. However, it is possible, that this is an homage by ’Jad to his own bla ma, and that there was a copy mistake in the colophon.

Text is the ""essence of the teaching of mchims"" (nam mkha' grags P1060 / blo bzang grags pa 1299-1375, P1298). The 2nd is the author of a commentary on AK called ""chos mngon pa gsal byed legs par bshad pa'i rgya mtsho"", which is very close to the title given in the chapter titles:  / chapter title: chos mngon gsal byed rigs pa'i rgya mtsho. In closing verses, but the first has a student called bsod nams ye shes. The text is described described as ""gzhung don legs bshad snyin gpo bsdus pa"", written without rang bzo and according to commentary.  No sa bcad, but chapters-divisions. Title in dbu can on cover page. Fols 35-36 on the same page. Presentation phrased in format chos can…te…phyir, and pronound ""khyod"" . Some kha cig, snga rabs pa. Citations in Indian texts. Many abbreviations. SB:; sku mched (in colophon) could either indicate that bSod nams ye shes was somehow related to mChims or that he was a ‘spiritual brother’ i.e. they studied together under the same teachers. This mChims seems to be mChims Nam mkha’ grags, as the latter had a student called “bSod nams ye shes”. If this is the case sku mched – instead of indicate that the two were fellow students – suggests that they were related. This makes more sense as here bSod nams ye shes touches the lotus feet of mChims implying a teacher-student relation among the two. In the Thob yig rgya mtsho, in Ngor chen Kun dga’ bzang po’s (1382-1456) gsung ’bum (W11577; vol. 1, 300:2) there is a lineage of the cho ga of the Mind Only method for the generation of bodhicitta (sems tsam lugs kyi sems bskyed kyi cho ga’i brgyud; 299:6); here we find “[…] shar chen po (Sharawa); Gro ston bdud rtsi grags (4th abbot of sNar thang); Sangs rgyas sgom pa (6th abbot of sNar thang); mChims chen po mKhas btsun bSod nams ye shes; [..]”. Between mChims chen po and mKhas btsun bSod nams ye shes there is no shad (although there seems to be some space between mkhas and btsun as if the two would not be part of the same word), but it is unlikely that this is the name of one single person. mChims chen po usually refers to mChims Nam mkha’ grags (which would also be the next in line since he is the 7th abbot of sNar thang and the person that precedes him is the 6th abbot) and btsun bSod nams ye shes seems to refer to the author of this text.

But it seems to include no references to Tibetan scholars, and generally avoids using the dialectical format characterised by discourse wtih various 'kha cig'. Despite the name, it deals with the material in a standard commentarial fashion, following the structure of the root treatise, rather than just focussing on various 'difficult points'. The attribution to Grags pa seng ge seems credible, and one feature of the work suggesting early composition are the unusually high number of Sanskrit terms that the author uses and refers to. A particularly interesting feature is that the author does not seem to make any distinction between different types of Madhyamaka school. Most importantly, I did not see any sign of a Svātantrika–Prāsaṅgika distinction. And even if a closer reading of the text were to reveal any, it is possible at this stage to say that the author gives no prominence to that or other distinctions among followers of the Madhyamka tradition.

But the reference to that work is not a mistake, since that is its distant referent. The text takes us on a long journey towards that work, through many divisions of treatises, biographies of both Nāgārjuna and Candrakīrti, etc. Then at the very point of bringing us to the door of Prasannapadā, it stops dead. Not a single word from the text is dealt with! Although one possibilility is that this was intended as the introduction to a much larger work that never materialised, this is not supported by how the text ends.

Drak. Kyotön would later write the biography of Chim Namkha Drak and Nartang’s ninth238abbot Nyima Gyeltsen (Nyi ma rgyal mtshan, 1225-1305), who was also a student of ChimNamkha Drak, would write Kyotön’s biography. Together these biographies are referred to bymodern scholarship as A Golden Rosary of Nartang (Snar thang gser phreng). The fact that Chim Namkha Drak taught these eleven biographies to Kyotön, and in this order, indicates that these works were taught as a collection from early on. Nyima Gyeltsen, the author of Kyotön’s biography and chronologically the last author in the collection, may have been the key figure in redacting the biographies by adding Chim Namkha Drak and Kyotön to the collection. Further, Chim Namkha Drak’s biography of Atiśa is also found in a separate collection, The Book of the
Kadam (Bka’ gdams glegs bam), which was also redacted at Nartang in 1302 when Nyima
Gyeltsen was the abbot at Nartang. This redaction was the product of Nyima Gyeltsen and two
other individuals: Namkha Rinchen (Nam mkha’ rin chen, 1214-1286); and another student of
Kyotön, Drom Kumāramati (a.k.a Zhönnu Lodrö; Gzhon nu blo gros, b.1271). 239
From 1238 to 1245 Kyotön studied with more than thirty Kadam masters at Nartang. In
1245 he began his own teaching career at the age twenty-six. His first opportunity to teach came
The Peltsek (Dpal brtsegs) catalogue that accompanies the Bka’ gdams gsung ’bum thengs gnyis pa incorrectly gives Skyon ston as the author of the following biographies: Chu mig pa chen po, Sangs rgyas sgom pa, and Zhang ston chos bla [ma]. The colophons for these biographies merely state that it was
compiled/composed at Snar thang (snar thang du bsdebs pa’o). However, these works are in fact the
biographies authored by Mchims nam mkha’ grags as found in A Golden Rosary of Nartang. Here the
colophons read: “compiled/composed by the monk Namkha Drak at Nartang’s temple” (snar thang gi

The text definitely has some interesting features, but much of the subject matter falls outside the area of scholasticism, and it is not organised in a dialectical fashion. It does not, therefore, appear to contain any discourses among scholars known to be associated with scholasticism. The key question is about its authorship. If it was indeed composed by Ratnakīrti (i.e., the Tibetan Rin chen, as opposed to the Indian Ratnakīrti), it would (I think) be the only surviving work by a figure who was a contemporary and perhaps student of rNgog Blo ldan shes rab, and would thus be historically important. The dates and place of composition in the colophon would fit with this. But there are two aspects of the content that raise doubts. These are the two topics it covers that are relevant to scholasticism. Firstly, it has a very clear sense of the distinction between the Rang rgyud pa and Thal 'gyur pa as a Tibetan distinction, and even attributes it specifically to Pa tshab Nyi ma grags. The clarity with which this knowledge is expressed seem a little questionable for its purported age. Even more importantly, it continuously returns to the distinction between rang stong and gzhan stong views. Hence, this would either have to be regarded as perhaps the earliest Tibetan source on that distinction, or is anachronistic. The latter seems more likely, since on 17b it has a reference to someone who is probably Dol po Shes rab rgyal mthsan. These two topics are anyway not really representative of the content, which is generally more practice/meditation orientated, and specifically the correct understanding of Mahāmudrā. I believe that the other Tibetan figure mentioned in it, by the name Zla 'od gzhon nu, is in fact sGam po pa. And rather than actually refuting him, the author here seems to be arguing that some of the former's students have misunderstood aspects of his view (JS). ",,,done,done,Colophon (etext).

The identified compiler makes it clear that he has condensed the original work. In what follows, he adds other material from lCe sgom pa (author of the original text) and from Kha rag sgom chen (author of 4_93_03). At the end of the text the compiler informs us that the block-print for the current volume is in the Zhol bka' 'gyur dpar khang. There are no other indicators anywhere in the text about when the compliation was made. But if the dpar khang mentioned is the same as the 'new' Zhol dpar khang, that would probably make it recent (after early 20th century).
